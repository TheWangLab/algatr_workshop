# algatr workshop <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="160"/>

**A** **L**andscape **G**enomic **A**nalysis **T**oolkit in **R** (**algatr**) was built to provide researchers with a step-by-step, start-to-finish pipeline to perform core landscape genomic analysis methods with their data.

## Installation and documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the [algatr GitHub page](https://github.com/TheWangLab/algatr) for information on how to install and cite algatr. algatr's README also has important information summarizing the package's functionality.

## Structure of this workshop

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this course, we provide brief lectures summarizing each of algatr's **six** landscape genomics methods. Exercises will refer to each of the algatr vignettes. Relevant materials are as follows:

| Lecture topic                              | Exercise materials       | Relevant references |
